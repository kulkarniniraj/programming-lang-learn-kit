# Learning any Programming Language through Sample Programs
(Topics are my idea, description partially generated using ChatGPT)

This topic list is for experienced programmers who want to learn new language. In my experience going through introductory documentation is quick but getting better grasp requires muscle memory. By implementing few codes for each of these topics, you can gain a reasonable grasp of the language's fundamentals and features.

## Topics

1. [Hello World](#01_hello_world)
2. [Variables](#02_variables)
3. [Conditions](#03_conditions)
4. [Loops](#04_loops)
5. [Functions](#05_functions)
6. [String Operations](#06_string_ops)
7. [Arrays](#07_arrays)
8. [Dictionaries (Dicts)](#08_dicts)
9. [Structs](#09_structs)
10. [Modules](#10_modules)
11. [Command Line Arguments (CLI Arg)](#11_cli_arg)
12. [Miscellaneous](#12_misc)
13. [Advent of Code Challenges](#13_advent_of_code)

### 01_hello_world
Basic installation and getting ready for hello world.

### 02_variables

1. **Temperature Converter**: Write a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. Prompt the user for the input temperature and the unit (Fahrenheit or Celsius), and output the converted temperature.

2. **BMI Calculator**: Create a program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) using the user's weight and height. Prompt the user for their weight in kilograms and height in meters, and then calculate and display their BMI along with a message indicating their weight status.

### 03_conditions

1. **Number Classifier**: Write a program that takes an input number and classifies it as "even" or "odd". If the number is divisible by 2, print "even"; otherwise, print "odd".

2. **Grade Calculator**: Design a program that calculates a student's letter grade based on their numerical score. Prompt the user for their score, and then output their corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, etc.).

### 04_loops

1. **Factorial Calculator**: Implement a program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using a loop. Prompt the user for an input number and then display its factorial.

2. **Prime Number Detector**: Create a program that determines whether a given number is prime or not. Prompt the user for an input number and then print whether it's a prime number or not.

### 05_functions

1. **Palindrome Checker**: Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Prompt the user for a string and use the function to determine if it's a palindrome.

2. **Quadratic Equation Solver**: Design a function that solves quadratic equations of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. Prompt the user for coefficients a, b, and c, and then display the solutions (real or complex).

### 06_string_ops

1. **Word Reverser**: Create a program that takes a sentence as input and outputs the sentence with the words reversed. For example, "Hello world" becomes "world Hello".

2. **Vowel Counter**: Implement a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string. Prompt the user for a string and then use the function to determine the vowel count.

Other: string length, concat, check and get substring.

### 07_arrays

1. **Array Sum**: Write a program that calculates the sum of all elements in an array. Allow the user to input the length of the array and its elements, and then output the sum.

2. **Array Reverser**: Create a function that reverses the elements of an array in place. Prompt the user for an array and then output the reversed array.

### 08_dicts

1. **Word Frequency Counter**: Design a program that takes a paragraph as input and outputs the frequency of each word. Use a dictionary to store the word frequencies.

2. **Contact Book**: Create a dictionary-based contact book. Allow the user to add, search, and display contacts by name, phone number, and email.

### 09_structs

1. **Student Record Keeper**: Implement a program that uses a struct to store student records (name, age, grade). Allow the user to add, search, and display student information.

2. **Employee Database**: Design a struct-based program to manage employee records (name, position, salary). Enable adding, searching, and updating employee details.

### 10_modules

1. **Math Helper Module**: Create a module that provides useful mathematical functions such as finding the square root, calculating exponentials, and computing logarithms. Import and use this module in various challenges.

2. **Date and Time Module**: Develop a module that offers functions to work with date and time, including date validation, formatting, and calculating time differences.

### 11_cli_arg

1. **Word Counter**: Write a program that takes a text file as a command-line argument and counts the number of words in it. Display the word count.

2. **CSV Reader**: Design a program that accepts a CSV file as a command-line argument and parses its contents to display each row's data.

### 12_misc

1. **Random Number Generator**: Create a program that generates a random number within a specified range. Prompt the user for the range and then display the generated number.

2. **File Encryption**: Implement a program that reads a file, encrypts its contents, and saves the encrypted version. Provide options to encrypt and decrypt files using a chosen encryption algorithm.

Feel free to adapt or modify these challenges to better suit your learning goals and the programming language you're focusing on.

## 13_advent_of_code

Challenge your skills with Advent of Code problems solved using your programming language.

## How to Use

Just implement one or two examples for each topic. If your language has more construct (e.g. if, case, when, unless) try to implement same code for each construct. By end of topic 11 you should have enough experience to solve any AoC challenge.
